**Introduction of New Super Melia Adventure**

Flow of the game:

Firstly, there will be a home page showing the heading of our text-based game (New Super Melia Adventure) along with a sentence asking the player whether they want to reload the previous game or not. The whole adventure starts with a main game, which will be a monopoly-based map game. The main goal is to be the fastest to reach the exit point and choose the winning gate. Players can select the mode of the game which is to insert the number and symbols of players and non-player characters (npc) respectively. Each player has 5 lives to start with. When players lose all lives (maximum 5), the players will return to the starting point with initial status (5 lives with no spells on hand). There will be random spells and black boxes which act as traps and rewards inside the map. The map contains an exit directing the player to a number of gates, either the “Win” gate or the “Lose” gate. The player wins the game if they successfully choose the winning gate, else, they lose the game.

- Main Goal
1. Be the fastest player to reach the exit
2. Enter the exit and select the “Win” gate
