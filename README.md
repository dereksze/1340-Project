**Introduction of New Super Melia Adventure**

Flow of the game:

Firstly, there will be a home page showing the heading of our text-based game (New Super Melia Adventure) along with a sentence asking the player whether they want to reload the previous game or not. The whole adventure starts with a main game, which will be a maze. Every player has a certain amount of coins and 3 lives to start with so they can either pay for buying the weapons or for defeating the final big boss. There will be 3 types of traps and rewards inside the maze, including small monsters which deduct the player’s coins or weapons, merchants which sell special weapons, traps which deduct the player’s coins. The maze contains a few exits directing the player to a number of mini games, a gambling centre to earn weapons and a weapon store to transact weapons, there is also an exit which leads to the final big boss. The player can pay to defeat the big boss using their own existing weapons or their own lives. If the big boss loses all its blood, the player wins the game. Else, if the big boss is undefeated upon losing all the 3 lives or the coins and weapons are all used up, then the player loses the game.
